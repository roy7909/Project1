Let's break down the given code and its function:

**NodeJS Code:**

1. `const http = require('http')`: This line imports the http module, which is used to create the HTTP server.

2. `const fs = require('fs')`: This imports the File System module, allowing the code to read files.

3. `const fileContent = fs.readFileSync('worksheet1.html')`: This line synchronously reads the 'worksheet1.html' file and stores its content in the `fileContent` variable.

4. The server is then created with the `http.createServer` method. This server sends the HTML file content as the response whenever a request is made.

5. `server.listen(80,'127.0.0.1',() => { console.log("Server is running on 127.0.0.1/80") })`: The server listens on port 80 and the IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Once it starts, it logs the message to the terminal.

**HTML Code:**

The HTML file displays an Employee Salary Details table. The main points are:

1. Styling is provided for the table, rows, and buttons.
2. Employee details are displayed in a table format.
3. Two buttons are provided: one for toggling the visibility of the salary column and another for calculating the total salary.
4. JavaScript code handles the interactivity of the buttons.

**JavaScript in the HTML:**

1. The "Show/Hide Salary" button has two events. A single click shows the salary column and a double click hides it.

2. The "Calculate Total Salary" button, when clicked, computes the total salary from the visible salary columns and displays the result below the table.

**Learning outcomes:**

1. **Creating a server using the Node.js http module**: The http module provides all the functionalities required to create a web server. In this exercise, you learned how to use this module to create a basic HTTP server.

2. **Serving HTML files on a server**: Instead of sending plain text as a response, you learned how to serve a complete HTML file to the client. This helps in rendering full-fledged web pages.

3. **Using the fs module of Node.js**: The File System (fs) module enables interactions with the file system. In this experiment, you learned to use the `readFileSync` method to read an HTML file and serve its content.

In essence, through this practical exercise, you've covered the foundational aspects of serving static content using a Node.js server. This knowledge is a stepping stone to more advanced topics like serving dynamic content, handling different routes, and integrating databases.
